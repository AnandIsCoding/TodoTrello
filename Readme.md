## 🧠 How It Works

- **Task Creation**: Users can add a task via an input field and submit it.
- **Drag and Drop**: Each task is draggable. Drag events are handled using the HTML5 Drag and Drop API.
- **Edit Task**: Inline editing allows users to modify a task by clicking the edit button.
- **Delete Task**: A delete button is available to remove tasks from any column.
- **Data Persistence**: All tasks and their statuses are saved in the browser’s localStorage, ensuring data remains even after a page refresh.
